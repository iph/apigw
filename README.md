## Building

This package uses a mix of npm and rust. In order to fully take advantage of the package:
- Download Rust + Cargo: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- run `cargo install cargo-lambda`
- install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm 

After that, each directory should have it's own readme  to build.
